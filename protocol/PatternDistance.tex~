have a rough idea of what is generic -- symmetry, accent structure, tala structure
have a mathematical model that has boundary limits using which patterns can be classified as generic and non generic
0 - 0.5  generic
0.5 - 1.75 generic and non generic boundary
1.75+ - non generic

But which operation takes it how far away from genericcity -- 


The distance measure between the pattern and the tala is measured as a function of:
Accent structure  A: [0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0]
Tala:             T: [1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
Loudness sequence L: [s w w w s w s w] {Sum of Loudness + weight of individual beats}
Speed Sequence    S: [1 1 1 1 [2,2] 1 1 1 1]

Distance = Sum( (A[i] - T[i])* { weight1*(L[i] - T[i]) + weight2*(S[i] - T[i]) } ),

In the above equation, speed and loudness have an effect on the distance only if they contribute to an accent structure at the beat. 
Using the above equation, it is possible to find 

Generate a pattern
Loudness array is also present
Certain notes have a weight due to their pitch
sometimes 2 notes are played which is a speed acccent
