From the the demographic details of the participants, it was found that the experience of participant P1, who was a trained percussionist, was way more than the others. P1's responses and comments and responses are given in the following section.



Although, other participants had differences and comments to offer about the accompaniment played by the system, the experienced participant felt that both the random strokes and beat patterns sounded equally good. Some of the comments indicated that the participant had observed different things about the accompaniment, however, the comments and responses indicate that participant did not observe anything vastly different about both the accompaniment styles and found that both were equally good.

This poses problems about the replication of the current study with experts. If expert performers find both the styles of accompaniment played by the system as good, and do not distinguish, but non expert performers had lot of comments to offer, how useful or valid are these comments towards solving the problem or understanding more about the nature of generic accompaniment patterns.
