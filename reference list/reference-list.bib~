	annote = {Musical co-improvisation systems should demonstrate the ability to predict the next melodic sequences for accompaniment based on what the user has played earlier. One thing that limits the X of co-improv systems is the fact that they the predictions based on a short term memory of the performance. One possible way to address this limitation is build computational models that allow the predictions to be based on longer memory durations. To do this, system S builds a music style analyzer and generator for prediction of sequences based on the theory of Variable Markov Model. The authors validated the performance of system S by compare the predictions made by the system before and after the implementation of markov models and test whether they have improved.},
